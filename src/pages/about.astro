		Hi, my name is Riza Ferdian. I am a student with a strong interest in technology, especially
		in programming, data, and application development. I enjoy working on small projects to
		train my logic and sharpen my skills in software development.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently, I am focusing on learning Java, Python, and building applications for both web
		and mobile platforms. Some of my projects include text-based games, order management apps,
		and small experiments with machine learning.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe learning by doing is the most effective approach. Thatâ€™s why I spend a lot of time
		experimenting with different programming languages and frameworks to understand OOP, databases,
		and application deployment.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading documentation, and finding
		efficient ways to solve problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is my space to document my learning journey and share knowledge. Hopefully, it can
		be useful for others as well.
	</p>
